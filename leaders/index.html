		<br />&#8220;I believe Naab + Griggs both have the experience and outlook to make sure the University of Cincinnati continues to be a institution where students have a say.

		<br />&#8220;I am choosing to support Naab + Griggs because I believe that at the heart of their campaign, they are student-centered. I have known both Andrews for over three years and I have witnessed their passion for bettering the student experience at UC. They are both innovative, results-driven individuals who implement plans that impact the entire student population. I believe that Naab and Griggs will also serve as good agents of Student Government, able to lead the 60+ person organization to create positive change in multiple facets of campus. This second point is especially crucial; it is one thing to have the ability to implement ones own ideas, but it speaks volumes when a team is able to elevate others to succeed as well. Naab + Griggs are that team.&#8221;</p>

They won&#8217;t only attempt to complete their own projects and support the projects of Student Government members, but rather to support the initiatives, serve as a voice, and protect the interests of all undergraduate students.&#8221;</p>

They&#8217;ve taken the responsibility of SG as you would a full time job, and their trail of quantifiable achievements prove that they were not only committed, but also capable. I think that they would be one of the strongest Prez/VP combo in recent times.&#8221;</p>

		<br />&#8220;Naab + Griggs are more than qualified to represent our community as quintessential Bearcats.

He has used his leadership roles on campus to spur on positive change that benefits ALL students, instead of just to make a name for himself.

		<br />&#8220;Naab + Griggs are extremely hard working individuals, like a tough challenge, and have an unparalleled passion for this University. They have thought out a very detailed-driven platform that is not at all fluff but is very attainable. I want someone who has experience and someone who stands first and last for old UC to represent our community. It is without a doubt Andrew Naab and Andrew Griggs fill that mold “to a T.“</p>

		<br />&#8220;Naab + Griggs are best to represent me because they both value and practice the ideals of hardwork, integrity, and flexibility. I believe these things are key to fulfilling two of the most difficult positions on campus. If elected, their love for and experience with Student Government will allow them to make a huge impact on the student body and student experience.&#8221;</p>

		<br />&#8220;I have seen Andrew Naab step up for our university since he was a freshman. He has a diverse involvement; he doesn&#8217;t focus on one area of campus but rather, many different parts. He has gotten to know UC over his years here and is now an integral part of many successes UC has had. While he is in a 5-year program, he has not lost any motivation as a 4th year student. I was excited to hear him stepping up again and can&#8217;t wait to see his platform when running for Student Body President.&#8221;</p>

		<br />&#8220;Naab + Griggs have distanced themselves as candidates to serve as Student Body President and Vice President throughout their time at the University of Cincinnati because of their ability to place themselves in other people&#8217;s shoes. They have spent countless hours giving back to the community and most importantly, they understand what the community needs. This diverse understanding will allow them to tailor their goals and work to achieve the continued success of every current, future and past student of the University of Cincinnati.&#8221;</p>

		<br />&#8220;Through their involvement and leadership experience in a myriad of activities on campus, Naab + Griggs truly have a holistic view of the student experience and the current issues facing the University. Furthermore, their support &#038; charisma empowers others to carry out initiatives of their own around UC. I support Naab + Griggs for Student Body President &#038; VP!&#8221;</p>

		<br />&#8220;Between these two guys, they have the most experience of any other pair on campus. They are truly dedicated to the University and making the experience better for Bearcats to come. I believe that these two guys are without a doubt the best for the job.&#8221;</p>

		<br />&#8220;I believe that Naab + Griggs best represent our community because they have been working hard towards improving the University throughout their undergraduate careers. Knowing them both on a personal level, I believe that they can utilize their critical thinking and collaboration skills to enhance the UC experience for students of all backgrounds, just as they have been doing throughout their tenures at UC thus far.&#8221;</p>

		<br />&#8220;Student Government is about conflict and compromise. In my three years on the inside, I&#8217;ve watched these guys deal with a lot of both, and lemme tell ya, Naab and Griggs are the pros. We may not see eye to eye every time, but they&#8217;ve always treated me with fairness and respect, and those are two things that Student Government could use a lot more of. This year, they are #MyGoldenTicket.&#8221;</p>
